## 📋 BTT Internal Evaluation Notes

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Python Compatibility | GREEN | The project's tech stack is centered on Python, particularly due to the use of RAG techniques and NLP tools which are available in Python libraries. |
| Data Readiness | YELLOW | Data is publicly available and under 1GB, but will require cleaning and preprocessing for effective use. This introduces some risks in the initial phases of the project. |
| Resource Check | GREEN | The project is designed to be feasible using the free tier of Google Colab, which is accessible and eliminates hardware constraints. |

**Student Fit Score:** 7/10  
**Technical Depth Score:** 8/10  
**Overall Recommendation:** REVISE

**Advisor Feedback Draft:**
The project presents a viable opportunity for students to engage with the complexities of NLP and model evaluation. However, they must be prepared for potential delays in data processing and a need for rigorous evaluation against success metrics.

## 🎯 The Challenge

### Project Summary
In this project, you will use publicly available AI research data (e.g., arXiv papers and metadata) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques with large language models to build an agent that retrieves relevant research, summarizes key findings, and translates them into business-relevant insights. This will help our organization address the challenge of efficiently monitoring and operationalizing the rapidly growing volume of AI research. Abhinav Raghunathan will serve as the KPMG business owner for the project, responsible for guiding business relevance, success criteria, and stakeholder feedback.

### Success Criteria

_Success will be measured based on:_
- Retrieval relevance: Ability to return appropriate research papers for a given query
- Summary quality: Accuracy and clarity of synthesized research insights
- Business usefulness: Extent to which outputs translate technical content into actionable business implications
- Human evaluation: Validation by KPMG stakeholders reviewing relevance and accuracy of outputs

_Human-in-the-loop checkpoint:_ 
- KPMG stakeholders will review retrieved sources, summaries, and business implications before outputs are used for internal decision-making, thought leadership, or client-facing discussions.

_A successful outcome will be:_
- A working prototype that enables natural-language querying of AI research and produces summarized, business-relevant outputs with citations
- Documented evaluation approach and results
- Demonstrated applicability for internal enablement and client conversations
- A final solution package that includes prototype documentation, evaluation results, scope limitations, and a final presentation suitable for stakeholder review.

### Stretch Goals

Potential stretch goals may include:   
- Add draft newsletter or report-generation capability for human review (e.g., research briefs or POV drafts, not publication-ready outputs)
- Introduce multi-source synthesis across research repositories
- Implement relevance ranking or personalization based on user intent
- Develop a simple front-end interface for stakeholder interaction
- Incorporate evaluation benchmarking dataset for improved retrieval accuracy

Stretch goals to be maintained within prototype scope; exclude production deployment, foundation-model fine-tuning, autonomous multi-agent orchestration, and use of PII, regulated, internal, or client data.

### Project Milestones

Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a **GitHub Projects board** to track tasks within each milestone.

| Month | Milestone | Key Activities |
|---|---|---|
| September | Foundation & Baseline RAG Development | • Data exploration and preprocessing<br>• Define evaluation framework and benchmark queries<br>• Develop baseline retrieval pipeline (RAG setup) |
| October | Pipeline Development & Evaluation | • Implement retrieval + summarization pipeline<br>• Develop prompt engineering approach for business translation<br>• Begin evaluation (relevance and accuracy testing) |
| November | Solution Refinement, User Experience & Final Delivery | • Refine model outputs and improve ranking/relevance<br>• Build lightweight user interface or interaction layer<br>• Document solution and prepare final presentation |

## 📊 Dataset

**Name and Source:** Publicly available AI research data from arXiv, specific to Artificial Intelligence   
**Format:** Categorical and Text, primarily in PDF format  
**Size:** under 1gb  
**Location:** arXiv Artificial Intelligence Research: https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent


### Key Details
arXiv (pronounced "archive") is a free online platform and open-access archive. Researchers use it to share **early versions of scientific papers—called preprints—before formal peer review.** It covers physics, mathematics, computer science, statistics, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, and economics.

## 🛠️ Suggested Approach

**ML Problem Type:** NLP / Retrieval-augmented Generation

**Note to BTT AI Coaches and Fellows:** 
We propose the following approaches, but work with your AI coaches to determine the best approach for your team:
1.	Use the provided link to the arXiv website with the repository of AI research papers and determine a way to build an agent that navigates to the site, evaluates all the links, downloads the files to analyze the content, and then generate the insights, etc.
2.	Download our sample subset of the research papers to ground your RAG solution and then build an agent that analyzes the content and generates cited insights. 


**Recommended Libraries:**
- [e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Hugging Face]

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- [e.g., Accuracy, Precision/Recall, RMSE, BLEU score]
